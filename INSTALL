PREREQUISITES
-------------
Points2Grid requires two libraries to be installed -

1) curl: Please install libcurl from http://curl.haxx.se/. Points2Grid has
been tested to work with version 7.20.0 of libcurl.

2) liblas: Please install liblas from http://liblas.org. Points2Grid has
been tested to work with version 1.2.1 of liblas.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
Please adjust the MEM_LIMIT variable in the Interpolation.h file to reflect
the memory limitations of your system. As a rule of thumb, set the
MEM_LIMIT to be (available memory in bytes)/55. For jobs that generate
grids cells greater than the MEM_LIMIT, points2grid goes "out-of-core",
resulting in significantly worse performance.

COMPILATION
-----------

If you have installed curl and liblas at non-standard locations, please set
your CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH to respectively point to the
locations of the include files and libraries of the installed software
pre-requisites.

To compile points2grid, simply use the standard cmake procedures:

mkdir build # make a build folder
cd build
cmake ..
make

The software has been confirmed to work with gcc3 and gcc4 on Linux, Solaris
and OSX.
