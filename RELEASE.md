# v1.0.1

We are pleased to announce the 1.0.1 release of the Points2Grid software.
Proven through thousands of jobs run via the OpenTopography Facility (http://www.opentopography.org), Points2Grid is a robust and scalable tool for gridding LIDAR point cloud data to generate Digital Elevation Models (DEM).
Points2Grid uses a local gridding method to compute grid cell elevation using a neighborhood defined around each cell based on a search radius provided by the user.
The local gridding approach employed by Points2Grid is most effective in situations where LIDAR shot densities exceed the resolution of the grid to be produced from these data.

Version 1.0.1 of Points2Grid is a minor release, adding to the prior 1.0 release.
Through the 1.0.1 release, Points2Grid is now available under an updated 4-clause BSD license.

Version 1.0.1 of Points2Grid can downloaded from otforge at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/otforge/files/points2grid/1.0.1/.
Please direct all feedback to the Points2Grid mailing list at: otforge-points2grid@lists.sourceforge.net.
